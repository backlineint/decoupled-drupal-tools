If you install this profile with composer, [allow patches to be applied from dependencies](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches#allowing-patches-to-be-applied-from-dependencies) and require `cweagans/composer-patches` in the root of the project `composer.json` file. The patch will be applied automatically.
